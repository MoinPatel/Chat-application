chat-application
It is a chat application with user name functionality.

///////Technologies Used:///////

- I have used node.js as the server so two people can chat at same time. 

- I have used the sockets.io framework so multiple user can connect with each other in real time.

- I have used Prepose which has similar functionality as gulp but it's gui interface.

/////Usage//////

To run application:

Download node.js from nodejs.org and install it.

After it is installed, open terminal and locate the folder name chat-application.

After that Download dependencies by using npm install

At last type in node server.js To run application.

Note: I used prepose to compile my sass file. Gulp was not working for me thats why i used prepose.
